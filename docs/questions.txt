TileDB-Spark:
- conflict reading json/csv file with spark.read.json() or spark.read.csv() with nature parser
- how to read and write directly from Spark dataframe when there are empty values or special array values for some columns? 
- when I am trying read TileDB array using pySpark, it says "io.tiledb.spark is not a valid Spark SQL Data Source". I am using Spark 3.1.1. 
	df = ss.read.format("io.tiledb.spark") \
	              .option("uri", "variant_index_tldb") \
	              .load()

Questions on Schema from csv file:
- I created array from csv file without specifying dimensions specifically. I was assuming it was using the row as the dimesion. However, the domain is from 0 to a very big number, much more than the number of rows of the original csv. what is that number from? And it seems all three Schema I created from CSV have the same domains.
